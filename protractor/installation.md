# Installation
You can use protractor anywhere. You can also put all these libs into your codebase if needed.

- Protractor
	- npm install -g protractor
- Astrolabe（used for page object）
	- npm install -g astrolabe
- Selenium Standalone Server & Chrome Driver		
	- webdriver-manager update

	- The alternate is downloading the files (selenium-server stand alone and chrome driver) and 	copy it to **/usr/local/lib/node_modules/protractor/selenium/**
